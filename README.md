# HBP survey plots 
This repository hosts the survey plots of the paper `Multidisciplinary and collaborative training in neuroscience: Insights from the Human Brain Project Education Programme`.
The figures 9-11 in the paper are created by the Python file `plot_survey_results.py`. The plots are controlled via arguments which can be specified via the terminal (for details see). 

Another file is `plot_teaslides_survey.py` which was used in an early version of the paper, and is upload here for completeness.

## Requirements
There are not many requirements to run the code, the two main Python packages are: 
- pandas
- seaborn

Optionally to create a Lickert graph: 
- plot_likert
